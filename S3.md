Consistent view: Allows EMR clusters to check for list and read-after-write consistency for Amazon S3 objects 
by or synced with EMRFS.


## Access Control and Permission
1. **IAM Policy**
   - Attached to IAM User/Group/Role, not buckets or objects.
2. **Bucket Policy** - (a resource based policy)
   - Attached to S3 bucket (not objects in bucket).
   - Permissions are applied to all objects in the bucket unless the object was created by a user in another account.
   - Allow control of unauthenticated access and allow conditions.
   - In JSON
   - Use cases:
     1. Can be used to grant access to IAM Users, other AWS accounts, or an anonymous User (“Principal”).
     2. Can be used to grant access to non-AWS identities with conditions.
3. **ACL (Access Control List)** - (a resource based policy)
   - Attached to S3 buckets and S3 objects.
   - Cannot deny permissions.
   - Not allow control conditions.
   - In XML
   - Use cases:
     1. Manage access to objects not owned by the bucket owner.
     2. Manager permissions at the object level, and permissions vary by object.
     3. Allow external accounts to manage policies on S3 objects.


## Read Consistency Rules
1. All regions support read-after-write consistency for PUTs of new objects into S3.
2. All regions use eventual consistency for PUTs and DELETEs on existing objects.


## Encryption
- Data at rest
  - SSE-S3  (Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys)
  - SSE-KMS (Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys)
  - SSE-C   (Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys)
  - CSE-CMS (Client-Side Encryption with KMS-Managed Customer Master Key)
  - CSE-C   (Client-Side Encryption with Client-Side Master Key)
- Data in transit
  - SSL

See also [Encryption solution for data at rest and data in transit](Encryption.md).

## Data protection against accidental loss
1. Cross-region replication
   - Cross-region replication is a bucket-level feature that enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across
     buckets in different AWS regions.
2. MFA Delete
   - If a bucket's versioning configuration is MFA Delete–enabled, the bucket owner must include the `x-amz-mfa` request
     header in requests to permanently delete an object version or change the versioning state of the bucket. 
3. Versioning
   - Once activated cannot be removed; only suspended.
   - Apply to all objects in a bucket.


## Cross-Region Replication (CRR)
- CRR is configured on a **bucket level** and provides an asynchronous replication of objects from one source bucket to
  one destination bucket located in different AWS regions.
- No retroactive replication, only replicates objects created after enabling CRR.
- By default, ownership and ACLs are replicated and maintained, but CRR can adjust these.
- Only Customer actions are replicated. Lifecycle events are not replicated.
- The storage class is maintained by default.
- CRR replicates un-encrypted and SSE-S3 encrypted objects by default.
- **SSE-C are not supported.**
- SSE-KMS is supported but needs extra configuration.
- When the bucket owner has no permissions, objects are not replicated.
- Add **bucket policy** to the **destination bucket**.
  ```
  {
     "Version":"2008-10-17",
     "Id":"",
     "Statement":[
        {
           "Sid":"Stmt123",
           "Effect":"Allow",
           "Principal":{
              "AWS":"arn:aws:iam::source-bucket-owner-AWS-acct-ID:root"
           },
           "Action":[
             "s3:ReplicateObject",
             "s3:ReplicateDelete"
           ],
           "Resource":"arn:aws:s3:::destination/*"
        }
     ]
  }
  ```
- You are configuring S3 CRR between two regions and want to be able to replicate objects using SSE-KMS.
  - Add `<ReplicaKmsKeyID>` to the replication configuration.
  - Ensure the CMK referenced is in the destination bucket region.
  - The CMK referenced by the `<ReplicaKmsKeyID>` item, is the CMK to encrypt objects within the destination bucket -
    since KMS is regional, it needs to be the region that the destination bucket is in.


## Optimal storage
- Data storage is “partitioned” across servers.
- The “partition-key” is the folder (if exists) and/or the name of the object.
- Random prefix (e.g. s3://mybucket/kdd8-monday/1030934.csv)
- Reverse sequence keys (e.g. s3://mybucket/10107102/1030934.csv)

## Storage Classes
1. **Standard**
   - Designed for frequently accessed data.
2. **RRS (Reduced Redundancy Storage)**
   - Designed for frequently accessed, non-critical, reproducible data.
   - AWS recommend that you not use this storage class. The STANDARD storage class is more cost effective.
3. **Intelligent Tiering**
   - Designed for long-lived data with changing or unknown access patterns.
   - Optimize storage costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective storage access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.  INTELLIGENT_TIERING delivers automatic cost savings by moving data on a granular object level between two access tiers, a frequent access tier and a lower-cost infrequent access tier, when access patterns change (not accessed for 30 consecutive days). 
4. **Standard-IA** (Infrequent Access)
   - Designed for long-lived, infrequently accessed data.
   - Minimum object size: 128 KB
   - Minimum storage duration: 30 days
5. **OneZone-IA** (Infrequent Access)
   - Designed for long-lived, infrequently accessed, non-critical data.
   - Minimum object size: 128 KB
   - Minimum storage duration: 30 days
6. **Glacier** (via Lifecycle management)
   - Designed for long-term data archiving with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours.
   - Minimum storage duration: 90 days
   - Glacier Vault:  keep your data safe forever

Lifecycle policy: S3 Standard -> S3 IA -> Glacier

## Event Notifications
PUTs, POSTs, DELETEs can trigger events.

## CloudWatch
- AllRequests, GetRequests, PutRequests, DeleteRequests
- 4XXErrors, 5XXErrors

## Use cases
- [EMRFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-fs.html)
- Storage and backup
- Application file hosting
- Media hosting
- Software delivery
- Store AMIs and snapshots

## Best Practices
1. Optimal storage - randomize naming structure for better throughput
   - Random prefixes on folders in S3 ensure higher throughput on read and write.
   - Data storage is “partitioned” across servers.
   - The “partition-key” is the folder (if exists) and/or the name of the object.
   - E.g.  Monday is the name of the partition key from this bucket: s3://mybucket/Monday/103094.csv
   - Random prefix (e.g. s3://mybucket/kdd8-monday/1030934.csv)
   - Reverse sequence keys (e.g. s3://mybucket/10107102/1030934.csv)
2. Upload operations: Single Operation Upload can upload file up to 5GB; however, should use Multipart Operation Upload > 100 MB.
3. Compression: Compress files (if possible) - GZIP, LZO, Snappy
4. Leverage custom data formats like ORC, Parquet, AVRO, JSON.
5. Use CloudFront for intensive GET workloads (cache S3 objects instead of making requests
