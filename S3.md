## Limits
- Objects can be up to 5TB
- Number of buckets per account: 100  (default)
- Request Rates
    - PUT, LIST, DELETE = 300/s  (default)
    - GET = 800/s  (default)
- No bucket size limit; unlimited number of objects in a bucket
- Versioning - once activated cannot be removed; only suspended.

Consistent view: Allows EMR clusters to check for list and read-after-write consistency for Amazon S3 objects written by or synced with EMRFS.

## Security
1. ACL - other accounts
2. Bucket policy - granular access to an S3 bucket
3. IAM Policy - S3 resource level permissions

## Encryption
- In flight
    1. SSL (secure sockets layer)
    2. CSE (client side encryption)
- At rest / server side encryption
    1. S3 (SSE-S3)
    1. KMS (SSE-KMS)
    1. Customer Keys (SSE-C)

## Optimal storage
- Data storage is “partitioned” across servers.
- The “partition-key” is the folder (if exists) and/or the name of the object.
- Random prefix (e.g. s3://mybucket/kdd8-monday/1030934.csv)
- Reverse sequence keys (e.g. s3://mybucket/10107102/1030934.csv)

## Storage Classes
1. S3 standard
2. S3 IA
    - Minimum object size: 128 KB
    - Minimum storage duration: 30 days
3. Glacier

Lifecycle policy: S3 Standard -> S3 IA -> Glacier

## Event Notifications
PUTs, POSTs, DELETEs can trigger events.

## CloudWatch
- AllRequests, GetRequests, PutRequests, DeleteRequests
- 4XXErrors, 5XXErrors

## Use cases
- [EMRFS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-fs.html)
- Storage and backup
- Application file hosting
- Media hosting
- Software delivery
- Store AMIs and snapshots

## Best Practices
- Data sink between services
- Store pre-transformation records
- Transformed records
- Results
- Randomize naming structure for better throughput
- Compress files (if possible) - GZIP, LZO, Snappy
- Leverage custom data formats like ORC, Parquet, AVRO, JSON
